              Coder's Library were created mainly for sharing our team's gathered books. During the pandemic we as learners also struggle to find enough resources for us to learn more about Programming, Coding and other IT based books and topics. Our team began collecting free pdf books so that we can easily share them as a whole.

              Our project started in September 2021 and hopefully will become progressive. Coder's Library is here to help learners to attain resources/books that are needed for them to attain their best capacity in learning, specifically in Coding and Programming. Supporting our project will help us improve our services more and probably expand our platform to attain wider range of topics and resources.

              other devices even if using the same account. You can somehow use this feature to save bookmarks from 
              a specific book without having an account. It allows you to save a book with or without label of bookmark. 
              The Label will be automatically labeled as "Not Applied" if Bookmark Label not provided.
